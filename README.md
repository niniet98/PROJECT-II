# PROJECT-II

## Overview
The main goal of this project was to identify a dataset of particular interest and enhance it by retrieving additional information using web scraping techniques or APIs.

## Dataset & Data Source

## Pipeline

**1. Identification of the dataset of interest:**
This phase involved at first, the decision regarding the project subject followed by the search of a dataset or even exploring public data sources, online databases and creating a dataset from scratch if it was no available.

**2. Collection of additional data:**
Once the dataset identified, moved on to the phase of collecting additional relevant data. This was achieved using web scrapping techniques to extract information from relevant websites.

**3. Data cleaning and preparation:**
The collected data, both the original dataset and the additional data, underwent a process of cleaning and preparation. This included dropping columns with unupdated information, standarizing formats and creating new columns based on other columns information.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations:**
Once the data was clean and ready, an exploratory data analysis was conducted. This stage involved the application of statistical and visualization techniques to better understand the structure and relationships within the dataset as well as generating graphs in order to help communicate the results.
