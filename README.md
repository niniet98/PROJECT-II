# Pixar Scrapping & EDA

## Overview
The main goal of this project was to identify a dataset of particular interest and enhance it by retrieving additional information using web scraping techniques or APIs.

## Dataset & Data Source
- [Pixar Studio DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandipdevre/pixar-studio12) from Kaggle.
- Web scrapping from [Pixar](https://www.pixar.com/).
- Web scrapping from [Pixar Films - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films).


## Pipeline

**1. Identification of the dataset of interest:**
This phase involved at first, the decision regarding the project subject followed by the search of a dataset or even exploring public data sources, online databases and creating a dataset from scratch if it was no available.

**2. Collection of additional data:**
Once the dataset identified, moved on to the phase of collecting additional relevant data. This was achieved using web scrapping techniques to extract information from relevant websites.

**3. Data cleaning and preparation:**
The collected data, both the original dataset and the additional data, underwent a process of cleaning and preparation. This included dropping columns with unupdated information, standarizing formats and creating new columns based on other columns information.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations:**
Once the data was clean and ready, an exploratory data analysis was conducted. This stage involved the application of statistical and visualization techniques to better understand the structure and relationships within the dataset as well as generating graphs in order to help communicate the results.

## Hypotheses
Concept art significantly influences film budgets by serving as a visual guide for the film's creative vision. The intricacy and quality of concept art impact resource allocation, potentially requiring investments in skilled artists and advanced software, which in turn can affect the overall budget of the production.

A fundamental financial imperative in the film industry is that revenue must surpass production budget expenditures. Moreover, the films that achieve the highest revenues attain a status of heightened popularity and commercial success within the industry.
